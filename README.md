# Code Smells
Quickly learn to spot code smells for yourself or a team.

Special thanks to [Llewellyn Falco](http://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/) and [Woody Zuill](https://woodyzuill.com/)
for introducing me to the material and Sparrow Decks as a tool. I am especially grateful for Llewellyn sharing
the material, so I could help in teaching other developers.
